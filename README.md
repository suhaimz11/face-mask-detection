Face Mask Detection
A real-time face mask detection system using a pre-trained deep learning model, developed with Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV.

Features
Detects whether a person is wearing a face mask in real-time using a webcam.
Pre-trained model (mask_detector_model.h5) for classification.
Two classes: "With Mask" and "Without Mask."
Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed:

Python 3.8 or later
pip for package management
Installation
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/face-mask-detection.git
cd face-mask-detection
2. Install Dependencies
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Download the Dataset
The dataset for training and validation can be obtained from Kaggle's Face Mask Dataset. Place it in the dataset/ directory with the following structure:

Copy code
dataset/
├── with_mask/
│   ├── image1.jpg
│   ├── image2.jpg
│   └── ...
├── without_mask/
│   ├── image1.jpg
│   ├── image2.jpg
│   └── ...
Running the Project
1. Train the Model (Optional)
To retrain the model using the dataset:

bash
Copy code
python mask_detection.py
This will generate the mask_detector_model.h5 file.

2. Run Real-Time Detection
Ensure your webcam is connected and execute:

bash
Copy code
python realtime_detection.py
This will open a webcam window with real-time mask detection.

Troubleshooting
Large Model File: If the mask_detector_model.h5 file is too large to upload, use Git LFS or share it through cloud storage.
Dataset Missing: Ensure the dataset is downloaded and placed correctly in the dataset/ directory.
Credits
Dataset: Kaggle Face Mask Dataset
Frameworks: TensorFlow, OpenCV
Future Improvements
Deploy the model on a web or mobile application.
Extend detection to recognize types of masks.
